      <h4><big>Question: </big> When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?</h4>
      <p><big className='fw-bold'>Ans: </big> There are many web servers built with nodejs that will then use MongoDB for storing data. MongoDB offers an API library that runs within a Nodejs application to give you programmatic access to MongoDB so you can create databases and then add, query, update or delete data from the MongoDB database.</p>

      <h4><big>Question: </big> What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</h4>
      <p><big className='fw-bold'>Ans: </big> JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.</p>
